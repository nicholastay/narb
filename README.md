# NARB: Nick's Auto-rice Bootstrapper

Modified off LARBS, Luke's.


## Installation:

On an Arch based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO nktay.page.link/narb
sh narb
```

That's it.


## Differences with original LARBS

- This script only works on Arch
- Added my own programs
- There is an additional screen to allow for optional packages
- Some services are enabled by default by the wizard
